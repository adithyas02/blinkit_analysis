# 📊 Blinkit Sales Analysis - Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing sales and product performance data from Blinkit (formerly Grofers).  
The dataset contains product information, outlet details, and sales performance, which have been visualized in **Power BI** to gain meaningful insights.  

The primary goal of this project is to help understand:
- How product attributes (fat content, item type, visibility, weight) affect sales  
- The impact of outlet characteristics (location type, size, type, establishment year) on sales  
- Trends and patterns useful for business decisions
